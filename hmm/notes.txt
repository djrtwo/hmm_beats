Module to convert a midi song to data for a ghmm model using music21
    input - data_set_name midi_paths
    
build transition model
    needs number of instruments
    otherwise, treat each midi note as a new instrument
    output arrays that can be used by ghmm
    
    hidden_state = total_drums - observed
    
    



Given a midi file:
    for each hidden/visible combination:
        build transition/emission
        build hmm
        get most likely sequence given the visible states
        compare against the hidden states
