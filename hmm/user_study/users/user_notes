USER 1 - (LEARN/RANDOM)
    after the first test, user said, "now I get it.  lets get going"
        appeared to be warmed up to the system, ready and more excited to get to the tasks
    
    when getting to the questions on the first page user comments "oh, i should have been paying more attention"
    
    when using system B, user's edits are almost always deletions
    when using system A, user edits less and makes more moves/additions


USER 2 - (RANDOM/LEARN)
    most edits seem to be deletions on the rows
    like USER 1, User 2 moves through the Section 1 on system B a lot faster
    does a few of section 2 out of order

USER 6 - (LEARN/RANDOM)
    many more edits on RANDOM
    ON section 2, accidentally left SYSTEM-B in the mix.  when I realized this at the end of running the System-A part and 
    mentioned it, USER 6 said oh good, because i was thinking I didnt agree with the stuff I said previously
    - user actively notice the difference between the two systems
    
    user notes that it seems like System-A gets stuck on particular things
    he also notes that the bass drum seemed to get stuck on off beats and wondered how he could control that

USER 7 - (RANDOM/LEARN)
    after section 1, the user asks if there is a right answer.  I say no, and reinforce that it is simply to aid in evaluating and improving the system
    he then goes to say that he likes both but that System-A seemed more musical.
    
USER 8 - (LEARN/RANDOM)
    very quiet

USER 9 - (RANDOM/LEARN)
    spent the first minute without the play button on
    worked out a rhythm in his head
    "that was system -a?  -yes-  It seemed more b-like that time"
    
USER 10 - (LEARN/RANDOM)
    a lot more edits on B (both section 1 and 2)
    
USER 11 - (RANDOM/LEARN)
    
USER 12 - (LEARN/RANDOM)
    didn't make any requests on section-3, system-a
