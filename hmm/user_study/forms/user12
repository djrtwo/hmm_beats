"In my open test of System-A, I requested a beat for one of the drums and it provided a clave pattern, so I was impressed by that."
Y "This is a really good way of coming up with rhythmic patterns, not just for percussion but for melodic/harmonic instruments as well.  It's easy to use, very intuitive."
Y "It would be really cool to use this in performance, even in conjunction with live instruments.  I think it would be cool also to play with the sound samples and replace them with other things, music concrete style."
"See my last comment above.  Also, it would be great to have some way of making triplets.  Also other time signatures would be cool to have too - 6/8, 3/4, 5/4, 7/8, etc"
"I think it could be really cool, kind of like another member of a band.  I do think it may need to be refined more to come up with more interesting patterns upon request"
