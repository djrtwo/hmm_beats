"The first couple trials with B had a tendency to closely copy another drums existing pattern upon request, which I wasn't fond of, but in the last trial it didn't?"
Y "Many times I was very surprised at the placement of the requested drums, which often shifted where in the pattern the downbeats layed.  Leads to interesting rhythms otherwise unconsidered."
